CRITICAL BUG FIX: Remove passenger ID field from booking submission

PROBLEM: The frontend is sending passenger objects with an "id" field (e.g., "passenger_1") to the backend, which causes Duffel API to reject the booking with error "Field 'id' can't be blank". Duffel generates passenger IDs automatically and doesn't accept client-provided IDs.

FILE TO FIX: client/src/pages/PassengerDetailsPage.tsx

CURRENT ISSUE: In the handleSubmit function around line 170-190, the passenger object is being built and somehow includes an "id" field. This must be completely removed.

REQUIRED CHANGES:
1. In the handleSubmit function, ensure the passengers array is built WITHOUT any id field
2. The passenger object should ONLY contain these fields:
   - type
   - title
   - given_name
   - family_name
   - gender
   - born_on
   - email
   - phone_number
   - identity_documents (if passport provided)
   - loyalty_programme_accounts (if loyalty provided)

CRITICAL: Do NOT include ANY of these fields:
- id
- passenger_id
- Any other ID-related field

CORRECT CODE STRUCTURE:
const passengers = passengerForms.map((form, index) => {
const passenger: any = {
type: checkoutItem.offer.passengers[index].type || 'adult',
title: form.title,
given_name: form.givenName,
family_name: form.familyName,
gender: form.gender,
born_on: form.bornOn,
email: form.email,
phone_number: form.phoneNumber,
};

// Add passport if provided
if (form.passportNumber && form.passportCountry && form.passportExpiry) {
passenger.identity_documents = [{
unique_identifier: form.passportNumber,
type: 'passport',
issuing_country_code: form.passportCountry,
expires_on: form.passportExpiry,
}];
}

// Add loyalty if provided
if (form.loyaltyAirline && form.loyaltyNumber) {
passenger.loyalty_programme_accounts = [{
airline_iata_code: form.loyaltyAirline,
account_number: form.loyaltyNumber,
}];
}

return passenger;
});

VERIFICATION: After making changes, ensure no line in handleSubmit assigns an "id" property to the passenger object.
