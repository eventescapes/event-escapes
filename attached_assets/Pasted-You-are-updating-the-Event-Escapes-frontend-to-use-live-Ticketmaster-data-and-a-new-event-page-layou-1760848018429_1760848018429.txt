You are updating the Event Escapes frontend to use live Ticketmaster data and a new event page layout.

1. Create a new React component file called `EventsRailsPage.tsx` inside `/components` (or update the existing `/pages/events.tsx` if one already exists).

2. Paste in the full React code below and ensure it compiles with the existing project setup (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui). 
   - The code queries the Supabase `events` table directly.
   - It filters events from today up to 4 months ahead.
   - It orders by `price_min` ascending (showing lowest ticket prices first).
   - It dynamically switches between “music” and “sports” events every 15 seconds.
   - It shows actual Ticketmaster event images and real ticket prices.
   - The event cards auto-scroll slowly (6 seconds per viewport scroll) with smooth motion and pause on hover.

3. Ensure Supabase environment variables are already configured:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

4. Add this code:

----- CODE BELOW -----
[paste the full EventsRailsPage.tsx code from ChatGPT here]
----- END CODE -----

5. Confirm the following visual requirements:
   - Remove “Book & Earn Rewards” and “Get Tickets & Earn $20” from all cards.
   - Show a clean card with:
       • Event image from Ticketmaster  
       • Event name  
       • City + date  
       • “From $XXX” if `price_min` exists  
       • Button: “View Tickets →”
   - Each card should use the color palette already used on Event Escapes (dark navy background with white text, soft shadows, rounded corners).

6. Set auto-scroll to be smooth and calm (not too fast).
   - Auto-scroll interval = 6000ms per viewport.
   - Rail switches (music ↔ sports) every 15000ms.

7. Test the page by visiting `/events` or wherever the component is mounted.
   - Verify that real Ticketmaster data (images and prices) appear dynamically from Supabase.
   - Confirm that clicking a card opens the Ticketmaster URL in a new tab.

8. Once tested, clean up console logs and ensure responsiveness works on both mobile and desktop.

After successful build, output: “✅ Events page updated — using live Ticketmaster data, smooth auto-scroll, and real prices.”
