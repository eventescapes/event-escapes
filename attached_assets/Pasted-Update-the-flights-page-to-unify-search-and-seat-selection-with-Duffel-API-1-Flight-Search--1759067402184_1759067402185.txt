Update the flights page to unify search and seat selection with Duffel API:

1. Flight Search:
   - Use Duffel’s /air/offer_requests to search flights.
   - Support:
     • One-way (1 slice: origin, destination, date)
     • Return (2 slices: outbound + inbound)
     • Multi-city (3+ slices, each with its own origin, destination, date)
   - Add UI controls for trip type (one-way, return, multi-city).
   - Display offers grouped by slice (Outbound, Return, Next City, etc).
   - Show airline, flight number, departure/arrival times, duration, price.

2. Flight Selection:
   - Allow user to select one offer per slice (outbound + return, or multiple slices).
   - Store selected offer_id(s) and display a running Trip Summary with total price.

3. Seat Selection:
   - Once all required slices are selected, automatically trigger seat selection modal.
   - Call Duffel `GET /air/seat_maps?offer_id=<offer_id>` for each selected slice.
   - If seat maps are available:
       • Render a visual grid with rows and seats.
       • Mark available seats (green), occupied (grey), extra legroom or premium (special color).
       • Show seat price if applicable.
       • Allow one seat selection per passenger per segment.
   - If seat maps are not available:
       • Show message “No seat map available for this flight. Continue without seats.”
       • Provide [Close] and [Continue without seats] buttons.

4. Order Preparation:
   - Save selected seat service_ids.
   - Only enable “Continue to Payment” button after seat selection is complete (or skipped).
   - Pass selected offer_ids + seat service_ids into the order creation payload.

5. UX polish:
   - Modal must always have a Close (X) button.
   - Seat selection should happen before payment, never after.
   - If multi-slice, guide user slice by slice (next seat map opens after previous is confirmed).
   - Make Trip Summary sticky/floating on desktop + mobile.

Goal: One clean flow — Search → Select flights → Select seats → Continue to Payment.
