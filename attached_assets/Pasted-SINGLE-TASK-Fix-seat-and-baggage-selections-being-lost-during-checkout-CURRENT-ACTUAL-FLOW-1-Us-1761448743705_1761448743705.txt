SINGLE TASK: Fix seat and baggage selections being lost during checkout.

CURRENT ACTUAL FLOW:
1. User selects flight ✅
2. User selects seats/baggage on ancillaries page ✅
3. User clicks "Continue to Checkout" 
4. User enters passenger details ✅
5. User clicks "Pay Now"
6. Stripe checkout page opens ✅
7. Payment completes ✅
8. Booking is created with services_data: NULL ❌

THE PROBLEM:
Services selected on ancillaries page are lost before reaching database.
There is NO cart/review page - it goes directly from passenger details to Stripe.

WHAT TO FIX:

STEP 1 - Ancillaries Page (where services are selected):
- When user selects seat/baggage, store in React state
- When clicking "Continue to Checkout", pass services data to passenger details page
- Use: navigate('/passenger-details', { state: { services: servicesData } })
  OR: sessionStorage.setItem('selectedServices', JSON.stringify(servicesData))

STEP 2 - Passenger Details Page:
- Retrieve services data from navigation state or sessionStorage
- Display services summary: "Seat 12A ($25) + 1 Checked Bag ($50)"
- Show updated total: Flight price + Services price
- When clicking "Pay Now", include services in Stripe session creation

STEP 3 - Create Stripe Checkout Session (backend):
- Include services as line items in Stripe session
- Pass services data in Stripe metadata
- Include services cost in total amount

STEP 4 - After Stripe Payment Success:
- Retrieve services from Stripe session metadata
- Save to bookings.services_data as JSON
- Include services in Duffel order creation API call

STEP 5 - Duffel Order Creation:
- Add selected_services parameter to order creation
- Format services for Duffel API

EXPECTED services_data JSON FORMAT:
{
  "seats": [
    {
      "passenger_id": "pas_xxx",
      "segment_id": "seg_xxx", 
      "service_id": "ase_xxx",
      "seat_number": "12A",
      "price": 25.00,
      "currency": "AUD"
    }
  ],
  "baggage": [
    {
      "passenger_id": "pas_xxx",
      "service_id": "bag_xxx",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 50.00,
      "currency": "AUD"
    }
  ],
  "total_services_cost": 75.00
}

FILES TO CHECK/MODIFY:
1. Ancillaries page - capture and pass services
2. Passenger details page - receive and display services
3. Stripe session creation function - include services
4. Booking creation function - save services_data
5. Duffel order creation - include services

VERIFY:
1. Select seat on ancillaries page
2. Select baggage
3. Click "Continue to Checkout"
4. Passenger details page should show services summary
5. Total should include services cost
6. After payment, check database: services_data should be populated
7. Check Duffel order: should include services

DO NOT:
- Create a cart/review page (it doesn't exist)
- Modify flight search
- Change confirmation page yet
- Break existing booking flow

FOCUS: Pass services data from ancillaries → passenger details → Stripe → database → Duffel
