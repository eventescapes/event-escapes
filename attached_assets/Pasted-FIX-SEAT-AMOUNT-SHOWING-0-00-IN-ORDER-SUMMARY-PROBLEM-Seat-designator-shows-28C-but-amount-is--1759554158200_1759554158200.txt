FIX SEAT AMOUNT SHOWING $0.00 IN ORDER SUMMARY

PROBLEM: Seat designator shows (28C) but amount is $0.00

ROOT CAUSE: When seat is selected, the amount field is not being included in the seat object passed to parent component.

FIX IN SeatSelectionModal.tsx:

In the handleContinue function, verify you're passing the amount:

const handleContinue = () => {
  const seatsArray = Array.from(selectedSeats.values()).map(seat => ({
    serviceId: seat.serviceId,
    designator: seat.designator,
    passengerId: seat.passengerId,
    segmentId: seat.segmentId,
    amount: seat.amount,  // CRITICAL - Must be included
  }));

  console.log('Seats being passed:', seatsArray);
  
  // Check each seat has amount
  seatsArray.forEach((seat, idx) => {
    console.log(`Seat ${idx}: designator=${seat.designator}, amount=${seat.amount}`);
    if (!seat.amount) {
      console.error(`ERROR: Seat ${idx} missing amount!`);
    }
  });

  onComplete(seatsArray);
};

FIX IN flight-results.tsx:

When storing seat in state, verify amount is present:

const handleSeatsComplete = (seats) => {
  console.log('Received seats:', seats);
  
  // Verify each seat has amount
  seats.forEach(seat => {
    if (!seat.amount || seat.amount === '0' || seat.amount === '0.00') {
      console.error('SEAT MISSING AMOUNT:', seat);
    }
  });
  
  setCurrentSelection(prev => ({ ...prev, seats }));
  setShowSeatModal(false);
  setShowBaggageModal(true);
};

ADD DEBUGGING:

In TripSummary.tsx, add this at the top of the component:

console.log('TripSummary received:', {
  seats: currentSelection.seats,
  seatsAmount: currentSelection.seats.reduce((sum, s) => {
    console.log(`Seat ${s.designator}: amount = ${s.amount}`);
    return sum + parseFloat(s.amount || '0');
  }, 0)
});

TESTING:
1. Open browser console
2. Select flight
3. Select seat 28C
4. Check console for:
   "Seat 0: designator=28C, amount=40.83" (or whatever the price is)
5. If you see "amount=undefined" or "amount=0", the problem is in SeatSelectionModal

Report back what the console shows for "Seats being passed:" when you click Continue in the seat modal.
