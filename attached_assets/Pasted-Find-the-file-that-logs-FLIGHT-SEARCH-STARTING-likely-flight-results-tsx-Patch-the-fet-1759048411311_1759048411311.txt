Find the file that logs “=== FLIGHT SEARCH STARTING ===” (likely flight-results.tsx). 
Patch the fetch/parse logic so the API field named `return` (a reserved word) is aliased to `inbound`.

1) Create src/types/flights.ts (if missing) with:
------------------------------------------------
export type FlightOffer = Record<string, any>;

export interface FlightSearchResponseRaw {
  outbound?: FlightOffer[];
  inbound?: FlightOffer[];
  // Some providers send `return` – keep it as an index access only.
  [key: string]: any;
}

export interface FlightSearchResponse {
  outbound: FlightOffer[];
  inbound: FlightOffer[];
  total_offers?: number;
}
------------------------------------------------

2) In the component that calls the search (the file you found), make these changes:

- State should be:
const [flights, setFlights] = useState<{ outbound: any[]; inbound: any[] }>({ outbound: [], inbound: [] });

- After `const res = await fetch(...)` and `const raw = await res.json()`, normalize like:
import type { FlightSearchResponseRaw, FlightSearchResponse } from "@/types/flights";

const normalize = (raw: FlightSearchResponseRaw): FlightSearchResponse => ({
  outbound: raw?.outbound ?? [],
  inbound: raw?.inbound ?? (raw && raw["return"]) ?? [],
  total_offers: raw?.total_offers,
});

const data = normalize(raw);
setFlights({ outbound: data.outbound, inbound: data.inbound });

- In the JSX, render both legs:
{flights.outbound?.length > 0 && <Section title="Outbound" items={flights.outbound} />}
{flights.inbound?.length > 0 ? (
  <Section title="Return" items={flights.inbound} />
) : (
  <div className="text-sm text-gray-500">No return flights for these dates.</div>
)}

(If there’s no Section component, map like you already do for outbound but using `flights.inbound`.)

3) Add a small counter near your green “Search Results” banner:
Found {flights.outbound.length} outbound and {flights.inbound.length} return flights.

4) Commit as: "fix: alias API ‘return’ to inbound and render return leg"
