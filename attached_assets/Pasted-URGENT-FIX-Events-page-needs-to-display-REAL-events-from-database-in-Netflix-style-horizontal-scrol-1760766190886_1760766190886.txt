URGENT FIX: Events page needs to display REAL events from database in Netflix-style horizontal scrollers

CURRENT PROBLEM: Page shows "No major events found" but we have 94 real events in the database

FIX REQUIRED:

1. FETCH REAL EVENTS FROM SUPABASE:
   - Query the ticketmaster_events table using existing Supabase connection
   - Use the search-ticketmaster-events edge function
   - Fetch separately for each country:
     * GET /functions/v1/search-ticketmaster-events?country=US&page_size=20&is_major_event=true
     * GET /functions/v1/search-ticketmaster-events?country=GB&page_size=20&is_major_event=true
     * GET /functions/v1/search-ticketmaster-events?country=CA&page_size=20&is_major_event=true
     * GET /functions/v1/search-ticketmaster-events?country=AU&page_size=20&is_major_event=true
   - Display ACTUAL events, not empty states

2. NETFLIX-STYLE HORIZONTAL SCROLLING:
   Each region section should have:
   - Horizontal scrolling carousel
   - Show 4-5 event cards at once (desktop)
   - Left/Right arrow buttons
   - Smooth scroll animation
   - Cards showing: event image, name, date, venue, price

3. EVENT CARD DESIGN:
   Small cards in horizontal scroll:
   - 300px x 400px
   - Event image from images field (parse JSON)
   - Segment badge (Music/Sports)
   - Event name (2 lines)
   - Date with 📅
   - Venue city with 📍
   - Price range with 💰
   - Hover: scale up slightly

4. CLICK INTERACTION - NETFLIX STYLE MODAL:
   When user clicks an event card:
   
   Open a large modal/overlay (Netflix style) showing:
   
   MODAL HEADER:
   - Large event image (hero banner)
   - Event name (large, bold)
   - Segment badge (Music/Sports)
   - Date and venue details
   
   MODAL BODY:
   - Event description/info
   - Venue details with map preview
   - Price range
   - Event start date/time
   - Filter reason (why it's a major event)
   - Any additional details from please_note field
   
   MODAL ACTIONS (2 prominent buttons):
   
   Button 1: "📦 Book Complete Travel Package" (Primary - Purple gradient)
   - Navigate to: /packages/build?event={event.id}&venue_lat={venue_latitude}&venue_lng={venue_longitude}&venue_name={venue_name}
   - This is your main revenue source
   
   Button 2: "🎫 Get Tickets on Ticketmaster" (Secondary - outlined style)
   - Opens: event.url in NEW TAB
   - This earns you affiliate commission/points
   - Use: window.open(event.url, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer')
   
   Button 3: "✕ Close" (small, top right corner)

5. MODAL DESIGN (Netflix-inspired):
   - Dark overlay background (rgba(0,0,0,0.8))
   - Large centered modal (max-width: 900px)
   - Smooth fade-in animation
   - Click outside or ESC key to close
   - Responsive: full screen on mobile
   - Scrollable content if too long
   - Professional, modern design

6. IMAGE HANDLING:
   - Parse images field (it's JSON string)
   - Use highest resolution image available
   - Show in both card and modal
   - Fallback to placeholder if no image

7. DATA TO DISPLAY IN MODAL:
   From ticketmaster_events table:
   - name (event name)
   - images (event photos)
   - event_start_date (formatted nicely)
   - venue_name, venue_city, venue_country_code
   - venue_address (if available)
   - price_min, price_max, currency
   - segment, genre, sub_genre
   - info (event description)
   - please_note (important notes)
   - url (Ticketmaster booking link)
   - venue_latitude, venue_longitude (for package builder)

8. HORIZONTAL SCROLL BEHAVIOR:
   - Smooth scrolling
   - Show 4-5 cards on desktop
   - Show 2-3 cards on tablet  
   - Show 1-2 cards on mobile
   - Arrow buttons to navigate
   - Drag to scroll support
   - Snap to card boundaries

9. LOADING STATES:
   - Show skeleton loaders while fetching
   - "Loading events from Ticketmaster..." text
   - Smooth fade-in when data loads

10. ERROR HANDLING:
    - If API fails: show error message with retry button
    - If no events in region: show "No events yet" (but this shouldn't happen, we have 94 events)
    - Log errors to console for debugging

11. POINTS/COMMISSION TRACKING (for future):
    - Track when user clicks "Get Tickets" button
    - Could add analytics event: trackEvent('ticketmaster_click', { event_id: event.id })
    - This is where you earn affiliate commission

12. RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
    - Desktop: Large modal, horizontal scrolls
    - Mobile: Full-screen modal, vertical scrolls
    - Touch-friendly interactions
    - Proper spacing and padding

CRITICAL:
- DO NOT use mock data
- FETCH from actual ticketmaster_events table
- Display all 94 real events we synced
- Use proper Supabase queries
- Show actual Ticketmaster URLs
- DO NOT modify flight/hotel search functionality

Build this NOW with Netflix-style horizontal scrollers showing real events, and Netflix-style modal on click with ticket purchase + package booking options.
