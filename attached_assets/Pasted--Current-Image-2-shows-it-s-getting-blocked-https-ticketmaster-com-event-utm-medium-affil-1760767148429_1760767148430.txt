FIX: Update Ticketmaster affiliate link format to prevent "browsing activity paused" error

PROBLEM: When clicking "Check Ticketmaster" button, users get blocked by Ticketmaster security

SOLUTION: Update the event.url to use proper Ticketmaster affiliate tracking format

CODE CHANGES NEEDED:

In the modal where the "Check Ticketmaster" button is:

OLD CODE (probably something like):
window.open(event.url, '_blank')

NEW CODE:
// Build proper affiliate URL
const affiliateId = '6581273'; // Your Ticketmaster affiliate ID
const clickId = `${event.id}_${Date.now()}`; // Unique click tracking

// Check if event.url already has query params
const separator = event.url.includes('?') ? '&' : '?';

// Add affiliate tracking
const affiliateUrl = `${event.url}${separator}afflky=${affiliateId}&clickid=${clickId}`;

// Open in new tab
window.open(affiliateUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');

ALTERNATIVE (if above doesn't work):
Use Ticketmaster's Impact affiliate network format:
const affiliateUrl = `https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/${event.id}?afflky=6581273`;

UPDATE THE BUTTON:
The "Check Ticketmaster" button should:
1. Track the click (for your analytics)
2. Build proper affiliate URL with your affiliate ID
3. Open in new tab
4. Include unique click ID for commission tracking

IMPORTANT:
- Use YOUR affiliate ID: 6581273
- Generate unique clickid for each click
- Test that Ticketmaster doesn't block it
- Make sure to track clicks in your database for commission reporting

Fix this in the events modal component where the Ticketmaster button is defined.
```
