TASK: Create a Netflix-style Major Events page for Event Escapes that uses REAL Ticketmaster data from Supabase

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:
1. NO MOCK DATA - Use only real events from the ticketmaster_events table in Supabase
2. DO NOT modify existing flight search functions or code
3. DO NOT touch hotel search functionality
4. DO NOT modify any existing pages (home, flights, hotels, bookings, etc.)
5. ONLY create NEW /events page and update navigation tab name
6. DO NOT change existing API integrations (Duffel, RateHawk, etc.)
7. Keep all existing functionality intact

WHAT TO CREATE:
- NEW page: /events
- UPDATE: Rename "Event Tickets" → "Events" in navigation (name only, not functionality)

1. UPDATE NAVIGATION:
   - Rename "Event Tickets" tab to just "Events" in the top navigation
   - Make it link to /events page
   - DO NOT modify any other navigation items or functionality

2. CREATE NEW PAGE: /events (do not modify existing pages)

3. DATA SOURCE - REAL TICKETMASTER EVENTS ONLY:
   - Fetch from Supabase table: ticketmaster_events
   - Use existing Supabase edge function: search-ticketmaster-events
   - Make 4 API calls to get real events (one per country):
     * country=US, page_size=20, sort_by=event_start_date, is_major_event=true
     * country=GB, page_size=20, sort_by=event_start_date, is_major_event=true
     * country=CA, page_size=20, sort_by=event_start_date, is_major_event=true
     * country=AU, page_size=20, sort_by=event_start_date, is_major_event=true
   - Only show future events (event_start_date >= today)
   - DO NOT use any mock/dummy/placeholder data
   - Display actual event names, dates, venues from Ticketmaster API sync

4. PAGE LAYOUT - NETFLIX STYLE:
   
   HERO SECTION:
   - Large hero banner: "Discover Major Events Worldwide"
   - Subtitle: "Curated packages for F1 races, music festivals, and championship games"
   - Purple gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
   - Search bar with 3 inputs:
     * Location/Venue search
     * Date picker
     * Event type dropdown (All Events, Music, Sports)
     * "Discover Events" button (gradient)

   EVENTS BY REGION - HORIZONTAL SCROLLERS (Netflix style):
   Create 4 sections with horizontal scrolling carousels showing REAL events:
   - 🇺🇸 United States Events (real US events from database)
   - 🇬🇧 United Kingdom Events (real UK events from database)
   - 🇨🇦 Canada Events (real Canada events from database)
   - 🇦🇺 Australia Events (real Australia events from database)

5. EVENT CARD DESIGN (showing real Ticketmaster data):
   - 300px wide cards
   - Event image from images field (parse JSON, use highest resolution)
   - Segment badge overlay top-right showing actual segment (Music/Sports)
   - Event name - USE ACTUAL name from database (bold, 2 lines max)
   - Date: format actual event_start_date with 📅 icon
   - Location: actual venue_city with 📍 icon
   - Venue: actual venue_name with 🏟️ icon
   - Price range: actual price_min - price_max with currency and 💰 icon
   - Hover effect: scale up 1.05x, show shadow

6. TICKET BOOKING FLOW - CRITICAL:
   When user clicks on an event card:
   
   PRIMARY ACTION - Show modal/overlay with 2 options:
   
   Option 1: "📦 Book Complete Package" (Your primary revenue)
   - Button style: Purple gradient, prominent
   - Action: Navigate to /packages/build?event={event.id}&venue_lat={venue_latitude}&venue_lng={venue_longitude}
   - This is where you sell flights + hotels + experiences
   
   Option 2: "🎫 Buy Tickets Only on Ticketmaster" (Affiliate revenue)
   - Button style: Secondary style, less prominent
   - Action: Open event.url in NEW TAB (external link to Ticketmaster)
   - This is the Ticketmaster affiliate link from the url field in database
   - Use target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
   
   Alternative simpler flow:
   - Primary click on card → Go to package page
   - "Buy Tickets" button on card → Open Ticketmaster url in new tab

7. HORIZONTAL SCROLL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Smooth horizontal scrolling with real event cards
   - Show 4-5 cards at once on desktop
   - Show 2-3 cards on tablet
   - Show 1-2 cards on mobile
   - Left/Right arrow buttons to scroll
   - Snap to card boundaries
   - Hide scrollbar (overflow-x: auto with hidden scrollbar)
   - Allow mouse drag to scroll

8. RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
   - Desktop (>1200px): 4-5 cards visible
   - Tablet (768-1200px): 2-3 cards visible
   - Mobile (<768px): 1-2 cards visible, stack sections vertically
   - Hero search becomes vertical on mobile

9. LOADING STATES:
   - Show skeleton loaders while fetching REAL events
   - Smooth fade-in animation when real data loads
   - Loading text: "Loading events from Ticketmaster..."

10. EMPTY STATES:
    - If a region has no events: show "No major events found in this region yet"
    - If API call fails: show "Unable to load events. Please try again."
    - Never show mock data as fallback

11. STYLING:
    - Modern, clean design inspired by Netflix
    - Dark/light compatible
    - Purple gradient accents (#667eea to #764ba2) for hero and buttons
    - Smooth animations (300ms transitions)
    - Card hover: transform scale(1.05), shadow increase
    - Professional spacing and typography
    - Show actual event images from Ticketmaster

12. DATABASE STRUCTURE (already exists with REAL data):
    Table: ticketmaster_events
    Fields to use:
    - id: event ID
    - name: actual event name from Ticketmaster
    - event_start_date: actual event date
    - venue_name: actual venue name
    - venue_city: actual city
    - venue_country_code: US/GB/CA/AU
    - venue_latitude: for hotel proximity search
    - venue_longitude: for hotel proximity search
    - price_min, price_max, currency: actual ticket prices
    - segment: Music or Sports
    - images: JSON array/string of event images from Ticketmaster
    - url: TICKETMASTER BOOKING URL - use this for ticket purchases
    - is_major_event: filter by true only
    - filter_reason: why it was marked as major

13. USER JOURNEY:
    Step 1: User sees real event on Events page
    Step 2: User clicks event card
    Step 3: Modal shows:
       - "📦 Book Package" → /packages/build (your main revenue)
       - "🎫 Buy Tickets" → Opens Ticketmaster url in new tab (affiliate)
    Step 4a: If package → User books flights + hotels + tickets through you
    Step 4b: If tickets only → User goes to Ticketmaster to buy tickets

14. IMPORTANT - NO MOCK DATA:
    - Fetch ALL events from existing ticketmaster_events table
    - Use actual event images from images field
    - Display actual event names, not placeholders
    - Show actual prices from price_min/price_max
    - Use actual Ticketmaster booking URLs from url field
    - If no events exist, show empty state, don't create fake data
