URGENT UPDATE: Launch Campaign Extended to June 2026

CONTEXT:
Our launch campaign has been extended. The $20 hotel credit promotion now runs until June 30, 2026 (255 days remaining). After that, it becomes $10 evergreen.

CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED:

1. UPDATE DATE CHECK IN ALL COMPONENTS

Find everywhere that checks if we're in the launch period and update:

OLD CODE (WRONG):
```javascript
const isLaunchPeriod = new Date() < new Date('2025-04-01');
const creditAmount = isLaunchPeriod ? 20 : 10;
```

NEW CODE (CORRECT):
```javascript
const isLaunchPeriod = new Date() < new Date('2026-06-30');
const creditAmount = isLaunchPeriod ? 20 : 10;
```

2. UPDATE REWARDS BANNER

Current banner shows "$10" - needs to show "$20"

Replace with:
```jsx
<div className="rewards-banner bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-400 to-orange-500 rounded-xl p-6 text-center mb-8 shadow-lg">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-2">🎉 LAUNCH CELEBRATION 🎉</h2>
  <p className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-1">
    Book Event Tickets → Earn $20 Hotel Credit
  </p>
  <p className="text-sm text-black opacity-90 mb-2">
    Limited Time: Launch Special Through June 2026
  </p>
  <p className="text-sm text-black opacity-80">
    Plus earn points on every booking: Hotels 2pts/$1 • Flights 1pt/$1 • Packages 3pts/$1
  </p>
</div>
```

3. UPDATE USER INFO MODAL

When user clicks "Get Tickets", the modal should show:
```jsx
<div className="modal-header">
  <h2>🎉 Unlock Your $20 Hotel Credit!</h2>
  <p>Book tickets and get $20 off your next hotel stay</p>
  <p className="text-sm opacity-75">Launch special - ends June 2026</p>
</div>
```

4. UPDATE REWARDS PAGE/DASHBOARD

Explain the program:
```jsx
<div className="campaign-info">
  <h3>Current Campaign</h3>
  <div className="launch-badge">
    🎉 LAUNCH SPECIAL
  </div>
  <p className="text-lg font-bold">$20 Hotel Credit per Event Ticket</p>
  <p className="text-sm">Valid through June 30, 2026</p>
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-600 mt-2">
    After June 2026: $10 credit (evergreen program)
  </p>
</div>
```

5. SEARCH AND UPDATE ALL INSTANCES

Search the codebase for:
- "$10" → Check if it should be "$20"
- "2025-04-01" → Replace with "2026-06-30"
- "April 2025" → Replace with "June 2026"
- Any hardcoded credit amounts in promotional text

6. ADD VISUAL INDICATORS

Make the launch special stand out:
- Use gold/orange gradient backgrounds
- Add 🎉 emoji to launch messaging
- Make "$20" bold and prominent
- Show "Limited Time" to create urgency
- Consider adding a countdown: "255 days left!"

LOCATIONS TO UPDATE:
✓ Homepage rewards banner
✓ Events page promotional section
✓ User info modal (before Ticketmaster redirect)
✓ Rewards/Account dashboard
✓ Any FAQ or help text about the program
✓ Footer promotional text (if any)

EXPECTED RESULT:
All mentions of the credit amount should show "$20" with messaging like:
- "Launch Special: $20 Hotel Credit"
- "Limited Time Through June 2026"
- Evergreen messaging should be hidden until July 2026

PRIORITY: CRITICAL
The backend is already configured for $20 credits. The frontend MUST match to avoid customer confusion!
